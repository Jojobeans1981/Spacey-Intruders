 # w = up
 # a = left
 # d = right 
 # s = down
 
 # space bar = shoot.
 
# press return or mouse click to begin or pause/unpause the game

# this is my attempt to put together a playable versaion of a classic scrolling screen game.
# Developed in pycharm using pygame modules. building this game helped teach me things like collisions and using random() to generate rendered Items to the window 
#Although nowhere near an expert, or even good, building ths game taught me a lot.
